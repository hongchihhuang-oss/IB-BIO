      "prefetchedInsight": "Key Concept: DNA bonding hierarchy.\n\nDeep Analysis: Phosphodiester bonds are strong covalent bonds forming the sugar-phosphate backbone. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak attractions between purines (A, G) and pyrimidines (T, C) that allow for strand separation during replication.\n\nFact: The enzyme described acts like Helicase, which facilitates the 'unzipping' of the helix."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'cis' arrangement causes a bend (kink) in the hydrocarbon chain.",
      "prefetchedInsight": "Biochemical Analysis: The kink prevents the molecules from packing closely together.

      "prefetchedInsight": "Calculation Steps:\n1. A = 18%, therefore T = 18% (A+T = 36%).\n2. The remaining percentage (100% - 36%) = 64% must be shared equally by G and C.\n3. C = 64% / 2 = 32%.\n\nFact: This rule applies only to double-stranded DNA, not single-stranded RNA."
