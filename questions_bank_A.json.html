      "prefetchedInsight": "Key Concept: Chemiosmosis.\n\nDeep Analysis: Protons ($H^+$) are actively pumped across the inner membrane. The resulting electrochemical gradient provides the potential energy for $\\text{ATP Synthase}$ to produce $\\text{ATP}$.\n\nFact: The pH of the intermembrane space is lower (more acidic) than the matrix."

      "prefetchedInsight": "Model Answer Structure:\n\nAmphipathic Nature: Phospholipids possess a hydrophilic phosphate head and two hydrophobic fatty acid tails.\n\nBilayer Formation: In water, they spontaneously arrange so heads face the aqueous environment and tails face inward, shielded from water.\n\nStability: Hydrophobic interactions between tails and hydrogen bonds between heads/water maintain the structure.\n\nFluidity: Weak van der Waals forces between tails allow for lateral movement (Fluid Mosaic Model).\n\nSelective Permeability: The hydrophobic core prevents large polar molecules and ions from passing through without specific proteins."
